# Football Analysis Project

## Introduction
The this project is to use YOLO, a leading AI object detection model, to identify and track players, referees, and footballs in a video. We'll also enhance the model's performance through training. Additionally, we will employ K-means clustering for pixel segmentation to assign players to teams based on their jersey colors. Using this data, we can calculate each team's ball possession percentage during a match. Furthermore, we'll utilize optical flow to analyze camera motion between frames, allowing precise measurement of player movement.
